# Computer System Guidance

A collection of *Computer System* Projects, built up from,

- OS
- Concurrent and Distributed System
- Computer Architecture
- Networking, Security, Compiler, etc

Application domain

- Database
- Game Engine

In addition, there are also references (paper, ebook, repo, tool, etc) that's interesting and helpful, ranging from beginner to advanced.
